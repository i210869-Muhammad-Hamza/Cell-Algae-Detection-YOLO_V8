Introduction

The detection and classification of algae cells are crucial in various fields, including environmental monitoring, aquaculture, and water quality assessment. Algae can impact ecosystems and water resources, making timely and accurate detection essential for management and intervention strategies. This project focuses on leveraging advanced deep learning techniques to automate the detection of algae cells in aquatic environments using the YOLOv8 model.

Methodology
Data Collection and Augmentation

    Data Sources: Collected images of algae cells from multiple sources, including public datasets, research publications, and field studies, ensuring a diverse representation of species and environmental conditions.
    Data Augmentation: To enhance the model's robustness and generalization, various data augmentation techniques were applied. This included:
        Random rotations and flips
        Scaling and cropping
        Color jittering
        Gaussian noise addition
        Brightness and contrast adjustments

YOLOv8 Model Architecture

    Model Selection: The YOLOv8 architecture was selected for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks.
    Transfer Learning: Leveraged pre-trained weights from the YOLOv8 model to accelerate convergence and improve performance on the algae detection task.
    Training Setup:
        Used a suitable loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy) for object detection.
        Configured the model with appropriate input size (e.g., 640x640 pixels).
        Defined anchor boxes based on the dimensions of algae cells in the dataset.

Model Training

    Training Process: The model was trained on a powerful GPU, using a batch size of 16 and an appropriate learning rate schedule to optimize performance.
    Validation: A separate validation set was used to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
    Metrics: Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results

    High Accuracy: The model achieved a high accuracy rate of over 95% on the validation dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and classifying algae cells.
    Visualization: Sample images with detected algae cells were visualized, showcasing the model's ability to identify various types of algae with high precision.
